            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The last people involved in this all-day adventure exclaimed, "Wow!" Don't spend your vacation at home; come here and have this amazing experience. This place has been very famous since 1955; many of our grandparents enjoy this river with its nature. The great flora and fauna have made it known as the Paradise of Huanuco. It is important to recall that many animals are very friendly here, like ducks, birds, and some foxes.</p>
